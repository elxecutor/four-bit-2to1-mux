## Features
- 4-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer implementation in VHDL
- Intel MAX 10 FPGA target (10M50DAF484C7G)
- Pin assignments for DE10-Lite development board
- Switch inputs for data selection
- LED outputs for result display
- Quartus Prime project files included

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition (23.1 or later)
- Intel MAX 10 FPGA development board (e.g., DE10-Lite)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elxecutor/four-bit-2to1-mux.git
   cd four-bit-2to1-mux
   ```

2. Open the project in Quartus Prime:
   - Launch Quartus Prime
   - File â†’ Open Project
   - Select `four_mux2to1.qpf`

3. Restore pin assignments (if needed):
   - The pin assignments are already configured in `four_mux2to1.qsf`

## Usage
### Hardware Setup
The multiplexer uses the following pin assignments on the DE10-Lite board:

**Inputs:**
- `a[3:0]`: Connected to switches SW[3:0]
- `b[3:0]`: Connected to switches SW[7:4]
- `sel`: Connected to switch SW[9]

**Outputs:**
- `y[3:0]`: Connected to LEDs LEDR[3:0]

### Operation
1. Program the FPGA with the compiled design
2. Set input values using switches:
   - SW[3:0] for input A
   - SW[7:4] for input B
   - SW[9] for select signal
3. Observe the output on LEDR[3:0]
   - When sel = 0: Output shows input A
   - When sel = 1: Output shows input B

### Simulation
The project includes Questa simulation files for functional verification.
